Su objetivo es proporcionar un marco unificado para compartir, capacitar y probar modelos de diálogo; integración de Amazon Mechanical Turk para la recopilación de datos, la evaluación humana y el aprendizaje por refuerzo; además cuenta con un repositorio https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI de modelos de aprendizaje automático para comparar con otros modelos y mejorar las arquitecturas existentes. También ofrece más de 20 tareas, incluye conjuntos de datos populares como SQuAD, bAbI tasks, MCTest, WikiQA, QACNN, QADailyMail, CBT, bAbI Dialog, Ubuntu, OpenSubtitles y VQA.\n",

      "FLOWERS O ' MAY Accordingly we went a-maying , following the lure of dancing winds to a certain westward sloping hill lying under the spirit-like blue of spring skies , feathered over with lisping young pines and firs , which cupped little hollows and corners where the sunshine got in and never got out again , but stayed there and grew mellow , coaxing dear things to bloom long before they would dream of waking up elsewhere .\n",
      "'T was there we found our mayflowers , after faithful seeking .\n",
      "Mayflowers , you must know , never flaunt themselves ; they must be sought as becomes them , and then they will yield up their treasures to the seeker -- clusters of star-white and dawn-pink that have in them the very soul of all the springs that ever were , re-incarnated in something it seems gross to call perfume , so exquisite and spiritual is it .\n",
      "We wandered gaily over the hill , calling to each other with laughter and jest , getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless wilderness , and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and sunny silences , where the wind purred and gentled and went softly .\n",
      "When the sun began to hang low , sending great fan-like streamers of radiance up to the zenith , we foregathered in a tiny , sequestered valley , full of young green fern , lying in the shadow of a wooded hill .\n",
      "In it was a shallow pool -- a glimmering green sheet of water on whose banks nymphs might dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in Cretan dale .\n",
      "There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems from our spoil , making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our baskets with sweetness .\n",
      "The Story Girl twisted a spray of divinest pink in her brown curls , and told us an old legend of a beautiful Indian maiden who died of a broken heart when the first snows of winter were falling , because she believed her long-absent lover was false .\n",
      "But he came back in the spring time from his long captivity ; and when he heard that she was dead he sought her grave to mourn her , and lo , under the dead leaves of the old year he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before , and knew that it was a message of love and remembrance from his dark-eyed sweet-heart .\n",
      "`` Except in stories Indian girls are called squaws , '' remarked practical Dan , tying his mayflowers together in one huge , solid , cabbage-like bunch .\n",

      "Again the Draken sent one of them after him to see what had become of him , and when this one asked what he was about , Lazarus answered : ' I will bring the entire forest home at once , so that after that we may have rest . '\n",
      "But the Draken called out : ` By no means , Herr Lazarus , else we shall all die of cold ; rather will we go ourselves to bring wood , and let you be free . '\n",
      "And then the Draken tore up one tree , threw it over his shoulder , and so carried it home .\n",
      "When they had lived together some time , the Draken became weary of Lazarus , and agreed among themselves to kill him ; each Draken , in the night while Lazarus slept , should strike him a blow with a hatchet .\n",
      "But Lazarus heard of this scheme , and when the evening came , he took a log of wood , covered it with his cloak , laid it in the place where he usually slept , and then hid himself .\n",
      "In the night the Draken came , and each one hit the log a blow with his hatchet , till it flew in pieces .\n",
      "Then they believed their object was gained , and they lay down again .\n",
      "Thereupon Lazarus took the log , threw it away , and laid himself down in its stead .\n",
      "Towards dawn , he began to groan , and when the Draken heard that , they asked what ailed him , to which he made answer : ` The gnats have stung me horribly . '\n",
      "This terrified the Draken , for they believed that Lazarus took their blows for gnat-stings , and they determined at any price to get rid of him .\n",
      "Next morning , therefore , they asked him if he had not wife or child , and said that if he would like to go and visit them they would give him a bag of gold to take away with him .\n",
      "He agreed willingly to this , but asked further that one of the Draken should go with him to carry the bag of gold .\n",
      "They consented , and one was sent with him .\n",
      "When they had come to within a short distance of Lazarus 's house , he said to the Draken : ` Stop here , in the meantime , for I must go on in front and tie up my children , lest they eat you . '\n",
      "So he went and tied his children with strong ropes , and said to them : ` As soon as the Draken comes in sight , call out as loud as you can , `` Drakenflesh !\n",

      "So , when the Draken appeared , the children cried out ; ` Drakenflesh !\n",
      "Drakenflesh ! '\n",
      "and this so terrified the Draken that he let the bag fall and fled .\n",
      "On the road he met a fox , which asked him why he seemed so frightened .\n",

      "We wandered gaily over the hill , calling to each other with laughter and jest , getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless wilderness , and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and sunny silences , where the wind purred and gentled and went softly .\n",
      "When the sun began to hang low , sending great fan-like streamers of radiance up to the zenith , we foregathered in a tiny , sequestered valley , full of young green fern , lying in the shadow of a wooded hill .\n",

      "There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems from our spoil , making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our baskets with sweetness .\n",
